> **Claude Code note:** `[Skill: X]` below means invoke the `x` skill via the Skill tool (auto-discovered from `.claude/skills/x/`). Where a step needs an MCP tool not yet loaded, use `ToolSearch` first (see `sap-dev-rule.md` §9).

[ROLE & OBJECTIVE]
Act as an Expert SAP Solution Architect and Technical Analyst. Deeply read and analyze a Functional Specification (FS) document, then translate business logic, UI requirements, and data constraints into a Technical Specification (TS) strictly aligned with SAP ABAP Cloud and Clean Core architecture. The TS you produce is the ONLY input `/sap-dev-create-report` will read — it must be complete enough that create-report never has to guess or design on its own.

[INPUT DATA]
- Functional Specification (FS): file(s) in `artifacts/fs_docs/`, or FS text pasted directly. Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

[GOVERNING RULES]
This workflow operates under the Iron Laws, Red Flags, and Token Efficiency rules in `sap-dev-rule.md` (§6-10). In particular: no TS handoff without passing the Verify Loop (Phase 5); progress updates use [Skill: caveman]; never re-print full drafts already saved to a file, reference the path instead.

[EXECUTION PROTOCOL — 6 PHASES]

## Phase 0 — Intake & Pre-processing

0.0 TASK LEDGER: Use [Skill: scratchpad] to create `artifacts/scratchpads/scratchpad_[ReportName].md` with the Ledger Format (TODO/DOING/DONE/FAILED) covering Phases 0-6. Update it immediately after each phase — it is the single source of truth for progress, not this conversation's history.

0.1 DOCUMENT PRE-PROCESSING: Dispatch `[Agent: consultant-executor]` with [Skill: document-markdown-converter] to convert binary FS files (PDF/DOCX/XLSX) in `artifacts/fs_docs/` into `artifacts/scratchpads/fs_markdown.md`. Skip if the FS is already plain text/Markdown. From here on, read `fs_markdown.md` only — never the original binary.

0.2 VISUAL EXTRACTION: If the FS contains images (UI mockups, flowcharts, Excel screenshots), dispatch `[Agent: consultant-executor]` with [Skill: fs-vision-extractor] to transcribe them into Markdown and append the result into `fs_markdown.md` under a clearly labeled heading (e.g. `## Extracted from Image: <name>`). Skip if the FS has no images.

0.3 DATA COMPLETENESS GATE (HARD GATE): Review `fs_markdown.md`. If the FS explicitly references fields/tables/requirements that live in an unprocessed image, an external link, or a table that failed conversion, STOP and ask the user to provide the missing information. Do not guess or use placeholder ranges (e.g. "Fields 1 to 39"). Do not proceed to Phase 1 until this gate passes.

## Phase 1 — Data Model Foundation (single dispatch — every later phase reuses this vocabulary)

1.0 DATA MODEL EXTRACTION + RELEASED CDS VALIDATION: Dispatch `[Agent: consultant-lead]` ONCE, naming both skills in the same dispatch prompt to run in sequence inside that one agent — do not split into two separate dispatches, the second step strictly needs the first step's output so there is no parallelism to gain and only round-trip overhead to lose: (a) [Skill: fs-data-model-extractor] on `fs_markdown.md` → internal Data Model Draft (Base Views/Tables, Joins & Conditions, Key Fields, Hardcoded Filters, Output Fields); (b) [Skill: find-released-cds-view] on that draft → verify every source is a released Clean-Core-Level-A CDS view (S/4HANA Cloud Public), replacing any unreleased/internal table or view with the best released alternative matching grain and field coverage. Output: **Verified Data Model** — the field/source vocabulary every later phase must reuse verbatim (identical field and view names) to avoid drift. Persist it as a `## Verified Data Model` section in `artifacts/scratchpads/scratchpad_[ReportName].md` — Phase 2's dispatched agents read this file, not conversation history.

## Phase 2 — Domain Analysis (parallel via dedicated subagents)

2.A/2.B/2.C each take `fs_markdown.md` + the `## Verified Data Model` section of the scratchpad ledger as read-only input and produce one independent draft. Dispatch all three via `[Agent: consultant-lead]` (parallel Task calls in one message, `subagent_type: consultant-lead`, no `isolation: "worktree"`); each dispatch prompt must name the one skill to invoke, the input path(s), and its own output path — read-only input, write only its own draft, no shared state.

Threshold (starting heuristic — tighten once real dispatch-timing data exists): dispatch sequentially instead of in parallel only if the Verified Data Model lists fewer than ~15 output fields total AND `fs_markdown.md` is under ~2 pages — below that size, three parallel dispatches cost more in spin-up overhead than they save. At or above the threshold, always dispatch in parallel — the result is identical content either way, only faster.

2.A UI/UX ANALYSIS: [Skill: fs-fiori-ui-elements-mapper] → UI Layout Draft (Selection Fields, Line Items, Sorting/Grouping, Object Page Facets). Output: `artifacts/scratchpads/draft_ui_[ReportName].md`.

2.B BUSINESS LOGIC EXTRACTION: [Skill: fs-logic-behavior-translator] → Business Logic Draft (Report Type, CDS-level derived fields, Virtual Elements/ABAP-level complex logic, Actions/Determinations, Clean Core violations + released replacements, Authorization Check). This skill already mandates MCP-verified replacements for any unreleased API it flags — do not skip that check. Output: `artifacts/scratchpads/draft_logic_[ReportName].md`.

2.C INTEGRATION & API ANALYSIS: [Skill: fs-integration-api-analyzer] → Integration Draft (Integration Pattern, OData Service Model, API Style Compliance, Field Mapping Table, Security/Auth). If the FS has no integration/interface requirements, output exactly "N/A — FS has no integration requirements" rather than skipping the step silently. Output: `artifacts/scratchpads/draft_integration_[ReportName].md`.

2.D RECONCILIATION: Read back each of the three draft files yourself (`sap-dev-rule.md` §12 — a dispatch's completion message is not sufficient evidence). To keep this cheap on context, read only each file's **Field Name Index** (the flat list at the very top of the file) first and cross-check those names against the Verified Data Model; open the full draft body only for a file whose Index shows a name that doesn't match, to get the context needed to resolve it. List any mismatch as a Conflict and resolve it (align naming, or return to Phase 1 if a field is genuinely missing) before proceeding to Phase 3.

## Phase 3 — Architecture & Coding Implementation Plan (the phase create-report depends on most)

3.0 ARCHITECTURE BRAINSTORM: Only when the Business Logic Draft contains genuinely complex/ambiguous logic (e.g. multi-level fallback chains, period-anchor balance calculations, a real choice between CDS Virtual Element vs. Behavior Pool vs. Custom Entity + Query Provider), generate 2-3 candidate architectures with explicit trade-offs (Clean Core compliance / Performance / Maintainability), pick one, and state why. For straightforward reports with no such ambiguity, skip the multi-option comparison and go straight to the obvious design — do not manufacture false choices just to seem thorough.

3.1 CODING IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (the section `/sap-dev-create-report` depends on entirely): using [Skill: naming-convention] for every object name, produce a complete table of every object to be created:

| # | Object Name | Type | Purpose | Source/Base + Join/Association | Field Mapping (which TS output field(s) it delivers) | Corresponding create-report Step |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

This table must cover 100% of what create-report's Steps 1-7 will need (Interface View, DCL, Behavior Definition, Behavior Pool Class, Projection View, Metadata Extension, Projection Behavior, Service Definition/Binding) — enough that create-report performs zero independent design or lookup.

## Phase 4 — Assemble TS

4.0 Merge every draft and the Coding Implementation Plan into the full TS using the template in [OUTPUT FORMAT] below.

## Phase 5 — Verify Loop (max 3 automatic iterations)

5.0 Cross-check the TS draft against `fs_markdown.md`:
- 100% of FS fields are present with exact names (no placeholders).
- Every field has documented source + derivation logic.
- Every row in the Coding Implementation Plan has a clear source/target and references no field absent from the Verified Data Model.

PASS → Phase 6. FAIL → fix the specific gap in the phase it belongs to, then re-run this gate. Log each attempt in the Scratchpad ledger's Verify Attempts table (see Scratchpad skill) so the 3-iteration cap is tracked, not just remembered. After 3 failed iterations, STOP — list the exact unresolved blockers and ask the user instead of continuing to guess (Red Flags, `sap-dev-rule.md` §7).

## Phase 6 — Handoff

6.0 Save the TS, mark the ledger fully DONE. If the session ends here before `/sap-dev-create-report` runs, use [Skill: handoff] to summarize state for the next session.

[OUTPUT FORMAT — CRITICAL]
Save the final TS as Markdown directly under `artifacts/technical_specifications/TS_[ReportName].md` (relative to workspace root). Do not add introductory or concluding remarks outside the template. Use CamelCase for `[ReportName]`.
