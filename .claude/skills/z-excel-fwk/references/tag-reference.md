# Tag Reference — authoritative

Every rule below is read out of `z/custom/excel/lib/ExcelExportHelper.js`. Where the old HTML training deck disagrees, **this file wins** (the deck's `${:rowType:{value}}` form, for example, does not exist in the engine).

## 0. The five regexes

```js
REGEX_TAG_IMG     = /\$\{image:([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\}/
REGEX_TAG_VAR     = /\$\{([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\}/g
REGEX_TAG_TBL     = /\$\{table:([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\.([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)(?:\|(merge))?\}/
REGEX_TAG_BARCODE = /\$\{([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\|(barcode|qrcode|datamatrix)\}/
ROW_TYPE          = /\$\{(?:rowType|row_type):([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\}/i
```

Consequences: names are `[a-zA-Z0-9_]+` only — no dots, spaces, dashes or diacritics. Tag matching is case-sensitive except `rowType`.

A cell is only inspected when its ExcelJS type is **String** or **RichText**. A tag inside a formula cell, a number cell, or a date cell is never resolved.

## 1. `${varName}` — scalar

Resolved from `data[varName]` of the current sheet.

| Situation | Result |
|---|---|
| value present | tag replaced |
| whole cell was exactly the tag and value is numeric-looking | cell becomes a **real number** (`Number(value)`) — the template's number format applies |
| value missing / null / undefined | replaced with `""`; if the cell ends up empty the cell value is set to `null` |
| tag embedded in a sentence | string substitution, result stays text |
| cell also contains `table:` | **skipped** in this pass (the table pass handles it) |
| RichText cell | each run is substituted individually, formatting preserved |

**Numeric-coercion trap.** `isNaN(newValue) ? newValue : Number(newValue)` runs on the *whole resulting cell text*. A cell containing only `${soId}` with value `"1000"` becomes the number `1000`, right-aligned, losing leading zeros. If the value is an identifier that must stay text, do one of:

- keep a prefix/suffix in the template cell (`SO ${soId}`), or
- send a value that cannot parse as a number (e.g. already formatted `SO-1000`), or
- accept the number and set an appropriate number format on the template cell.

Dates: send them as pre-formatted strings from ABAP (`|{ lv_date DATE = USER }|`). A date string like `2026-09-18` is not numeric, so it stays text.

## 2. `${image:varName}` — picture

- Value: a data URI (`data:image/png;base64,...`) or bare base64 — the engine prefixes `data:image/png;base64,` when `data:image` is absent, and always registers the image with `extension:'png'`.
- The tag cell is cleared, and the image is anchored `tl` = the tag cell, `br` = the **end of the merge range** when the tag sits on a merge master, otherwise the same single cell. `editAs:'twoCell'` — the image stretches to the box and follows row/column resizing.
- So: **merge the cells first, put the tag in the top-left of that merge**, and the logo fills that box exactly.
- A missing value leaves the cell empty and inserts nothing — no error.

ABAP side: use the released helper rather than encoding by hand.

```abap
ls_data-logo = zcl_image_lib=>get_latest_image_base64( iv_image_id = 'this_is_logo' ).
" returns |data:{ mime_type };base64,{ ... }| from ZI_IMG_I, latest version, '' on any failure
```

## 3. `${varName|barcode}` / `|qrcode` / `|datamatrix`

Rendered client-side with bwip-js onto a canvas, inserted as PNG, same anchoring/merge behaviour as `${image:}`.

| Suffix | bwip-js bcid | Extras |
|---|---|---|
| `barcode` | `code128` | height 12 mm, human-readable text printed underneath, centered |
| `qrcode` | `qrcode` | scale 3, padding 5 |
| `datamatrix` | `datamatrix` | scale 3, padding 5 |

The value is stringified. Empty/null → nothing drawn, cell cleared. A bwip-js failure is logged to the console and swallowed — the export still succeeds with a blank cell, so a missing barcode is a console-only symptom.

## 4. `${table:arrayName.fieldName}` — the item table

The engine scans the sheet for rows containing any `${table:...}` or `${rowType:...}` tag. Those rows form one contiguous **template block** from the first to the last such row. For each element of `data[arrayName]` it appends a copy of the matching template row, then deletes the whole template block.

Critical properties:

1. **One array per sheet.** `tableArrayName` is a single variable, overwritten by each match. Two different array names in one sheet means only the last one seen drives the loop, and the other's tags are filled from the wrong item. Design around it (see SKILL.md §4).
2. Everything in a template row is cloned: static text, borders, fills, fonts, number formats, row height, and horizontal merges.
3. If a cell's content is **exactly** the tag, the raw value is assigned (numbers stay numbers → number format applies). If the tag is embedded in text, a string replacement happens and the cell becomes text.
4. A missing field on an item becomes `""` — the tag is removed, never printed.
5. Rows are inserted in chunks of 10 000 to survive large payloads.

### `|merge` — vertical auto-merge

`${table:items.storeName|merge}` marks that column for post-processing: after expansion, vertically adjacent cells **with equal values** are merged into one. Comparison is on the cell value (objects compared via `JSON.stringify`). Sort the array in ABAP so equal values are adjacent — the engine does not sort.

### `${rowType:LEVEL}` — multiple row layouts

Put `${rowType:L1}` anywhere in a template row to register that row as the layout variant named `L1`. The tag text is stripped from the cell (the rest of the cell's text survives, so `Subtotal ${rowType:L2}` renders as `Subtotal`). A row carrying only a `rowType` tag and no `table:` tag still counts as part of the template block.

At render time each item picks its layout with `item.row_type || item.rowType || "DEFAULT"`, falling back to the `DEFAULT` variant (the template row that has no `rowType` tag). An item whose `rowType` matches nothing and where no `DEFAULT` row exists is **silently skipped**.

Typical use — `material_report_styled.xlsx` defines `L1`, `L2`, `L3` for group header / detail / subtotal rows; ABAP emits one flat array where each item carries `row_type`.

> `${table:items.rowType}` is something else entirely: it *prints* the field. Both can coexist (`store_revenue_tmp.xlsx` does this).

## 5. Layout features carried over automatically

| Feature | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Column widths / hidden columns / column styles | copied from template sheet 1 |
| Merged cells outside the table block | copied as-is |
| Horizontal merges inside a template row | re-applied to every generated row |
| Static images in the template | copied |
| Conditional formatting | copied, and ranges that overlap or sit below the table block are shifted/expanded by the number of generated rows |
| Formula cells | copied, but cells whose formula errored, or whose formula contains `IMAGE`, are blanked |

Conditional formatting is therefore the supported way to do data-dependent colouring (e.g. negative variance in red) — the engine does not colour by value on its own.

## 6. Quick grammar card

```
${companyName}                      scalar
${image:logo}                       picture, fills its merge box
${soId|qrcode}                      QR, fills its merge box
${soId|barcode}                     Code128 + caption
${soId|datamatrix}                  DataMatrix
${table:items.matId}                item column
${table:items.storeName|merge}      item column + vertical auto-merge
${rowType:L2}                       marks this template row as layout "L2"
```
